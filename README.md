# Tenants
Mongo remote collection driver to provide multi-tenancy support in Meteor Applications.

```
meteor add donstephan:tenants
```

### Setup

Start by initializing your tenants on startup. This provides a key, value lookup to initialize the tenants remote connection string.
```
import { Tenants } from 'meteor/donstephan:tenants';

Tenants.set({
  "tenant_1": "mongodb://127.0.0.1:3001/tenant_1",
  "tenant_2": process.env.TENANT_2,
  ...
});
```

Use collections as you normally would on the server and client:
```
const Links = new Mongo.Collection('links');

// inserts into your default tenant (i.e. MONGO_URL)
Links.insert({ name: "Bema Technologies", url: "https://bema.dev" });

// inserts into another tenant you set up, see above
Links.from("tenant_1").insert({ name: "Meteor", url: "https://meteor.com" });

const tenantLinks = Links.from("tenant_1").findOne();
// { name: "Meteor", url: "https://meteor.com" }

// example publish
Meteor.publish("tenants", () => {
  return [
    Links.find({}), // publish all links from main db
    Links.from("tenant_1").find({}) // publish links from tenant
  ]
});
```

```
// example attaching simpl-schema across all your tenant collections
import SimpleSchema from 'simpl-schema';

const Books = new Mongo.Collection("books");

const BookSchema = new SimpleSchema({
  title: String,
  author: String,
  description: {
    type: String,
    optional: true
  }
});

// this runs before the .from() command finishes
// will await any promises
Books.onFirstConnection((collection, tenant) => {
  collection.attachSchema(BookSchema);
});
```

### Why tenants?
Sometimes you really do need data separation in seprate Mongo databases and/or clusters. Tenants makes this really easy to do all while utilizing the very helpful collection interface that Meteor provides.

### Security Note
Please note that in order to do the client side lookup of tenants `Collection.from(<tenant-name>)`, the `_tenant` collection is published to all clients. If you don't want a user to be able to see names of your tenants, use a UUID for a tenant name i.e. `6hKFY9zTpyNj5Gp6m: "mongodb://127.0.0.1:3001/tenant_1"` instead of something like `bema: "mongodb://127.0.0.1:3001/tenant_1"`. You can also disable auto-publish of that collection when you set your tenants and control that piece yourself (example TODO). This collection is published in order to keep collection names unique. See how it works below.

### Other Notes
* Mongo indexes (and other startup functions) will not translate across tenants since they are applied on a raw collection. You will have to make sure to perform `createIndex` on each tenant collection i.e. `Links.onFirstConnection((collection) => collection.rawCollection().createIndex({ title: 1 }))`.

### API
**Tenants.set(tenants, disableAutoPublish, remoteConnectionOptions)**
```
// see example above
**tenants**: [{ [tenantName, remoteConnectionString, ...more tenants ]}];

**disableAutoPublish**:  allowed you to disable to default publication of the tenants collection.
This effectively removes client side `from()` commands unless you explicitly publish the tenant
doc for the tenant who is trying to access the local collection. You would have to do something like:

// on the server
import { Tenants } from "meteor/donstephan:tenants";

Meteor.publish("tenant", () => Tenants.collection.find({ name: "tenant_1" }));

In order to hook up functionality for LocalCollection to be accessed for that tenant.

**remoteConnectionOptions**: Mongo driver remote connection options.
See http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.0/reference/connecting/connection-settings/.
```

**<Mongo.Collection>.onFirstConnection(collection, tenant)**
Performs a func the first time a tenant collection is fetched. Runs before `.from()` finishes. It will await promises. Useful to set things like indexes, allow/deny rules, schemas, grapher queries, collection hooks, etc etc.
```
const Books = new Mongo.Collection("books");

const BookSchema = new SimpleSchema({
  date: Date,
  title: String,
  description: {
    type: String,
    optional: true
  }
});

Books.onFirstConnection((collection, tenant) => {
  collection.attachSchema(BookSchema);

  collection.allow({
    insert: () => false,
    update: () => false,
    remove: () => false,
  });

  collection.deny({
    insert: () => false,
    update: () => false,
    remove: () => false,
  });
});
```

**Tenants.get()**
Note this also returns the default tenant collection (i.e. the main tenant or your `MONGO_URL`).
```
const tenants = Tenants.get();

// ["", "tenant_1", "tenant_2];
```

**Tenant.collection**
```
let tenants = Tenents.collection.find({}).fetch();

/*
[
  { "_id" : "fYBqzNsBdd4kFi6S8", "name" : "tenant_1", "key" : 0 },
  { "_id" : "fYBqzNsBdd4kFi6S8", "name" : "tenant_2", "key" : 1 }
]
*/
```

### Environment
Optional settings can be set below. All settings can also be adjusted as well by setting the `Tenants.<settingName>` value.

**TENANT_POOL_DISCONNECT_TIME**: ms to disconnect a collection since it has been accessed. Default is 30000 (30 seconds).
**TENANTS_CLEANUP_INTERVAL**: ms to run GC cleanup on inactive tenant collections. Default is 30000 (30 seconds).

### How it works
All tenants does is extends an option on the Collection class to provide references to different collections when `<Mongo.Collection>.from(<tenant-x>)` is called. In order to get by the requirement of unique single collection names (because of the internal Meteor mutation methods and to prevent tenant collection overlap), we store a `_tenants` collection in the main DB. This maps a unique collection name for each tenant with a simple count. If we use the `Links` example from above, in your main db the collection name would be `links`, for `tenant_1` the collection is named `links_0`, for `tenant_2` the collection is named `links_1`, and so on and so on.
